# Localization Analyzer

A repository for scripts and tools to analyze the performance of lidar odometry and the SLAM system.
Primarily used for [LOCUS](https://github.com/NeBula-Autonomy/LOCUS) and [LAMP](https://github.com/NeBula-Autonomy/LAMP) evaluation.
The package is a wrapper for awesome trajectory analyzing tool [evo](https://github.com/MichaelGrupp/evo).

# How to install

```
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install seaborn
pip3 install evo
```
After installation complete reboot because ```evo``` needs that, then in your ```catkin_ws``` workspace

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/NeBula-Autonomy/localization_analyzer.git
```

# How to run
## How to store data in order to run the scripts

To run the scripts smoothly you should have the following folder structure for dataset that you are going to evaluate. Assuming the folder is called ```test_localization_analyzer_dataset```. In this folder you should have the following folders and files

```
+-- ground_truth
|   +-- odometry.bag
+-- specific_method_run_number
|   +-- cpu.bag
|   +-- delay.txt
|   +-- mem.bag
|   +-- odometry.bag
|   +-- rate.txt
+-- specific_method2_run_number
|   +-- cpu.bag
|   +-- delay.txt
|   +-- mem.bag
|   +-- odometry.bag
|   +-- rate.txt
+-- specific_method3_run_number
|   +-- cpu.bag
|   +-- delay.txt
|   +-- mem.bag
|   +-- odometry.bag
|   +-- rate.txt
```
Folder naming:
- ```specific_method```, ```specific_method2```, ```specific_method3``` corresponds to the names in ```specific_methods``` in [config/analyzer_settings.yaml](https://github.com/NeBula-Autonomy/localization_analyzer/blob/main/config/analyzer_settings.yaml)

- ```run_number``` - corresponds to the test name that you specified for your tests (see [run_analyzer.yaml](https://github.com/NeBula-Autonomy/localization_analyzer/blob/main/scripts/run_analyzer.yaml) for example)

- ```ground_truth``` - folder where you store bag folder with the ground truth (needs to be called ```odometry.bag```)

Files description:
- ```cpu.bag``` and ```mem.bag``` - produced from ```monitor.py```. See [LOCUS scripts]() how to use it.

- ```delay.txt``` - dekay of the odometry topic
```
rostopic delay <odometry_topic> -w3 >> /path/to/test_localization_analyzer_dataset/specific_method_run_number/delay.txt
```

- ```rate.txt``` - rate of the odometry topic
```
rostopic hz <odometry_topic> -w3 >> /path/to/test_localization_analyzer_dataset/specific_method_run_number/rate.txt
```

- ```odometry.bag``` - recorded odometry information
```
rosbag record -O /path/to/test_localization_analyzer_dataset/specific_method_run_number/odometry.bag <odometry_topic>
```

## Run script

For easy run go to 
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/localization_analyzer/scripts/
```
setup variables in ```run_analyzer.yaml``` and run 
```
tmuxp load run_analyzer.yaml
```
(see [run_analyzer.yaml](https://github.com/NeBula-Autonomy/localization_analyzer/blob/main/scripts/run_analyzer.yaml) for easy use)

**(Alternative)**

If you prefer run python script from the command line directly:
```
python $(rospack find localization_analyzer)/scripts/analyzer.py <data/path/to/your/folder> <robot_name> <robot_odometry_topic> <test_name>
```

```<data/path/to/your/folder>``` - path to the main folder where your recorded bag data is (e.g. path to ```test_localization_analyzer_dataset```)

```<robot_name>``` - robot namespace

```<robot_odometry_topic>``` - topic of the odometry (needs to contain robot namespace)

```<test_name>``` - name of the test
